# CLAUDE.md for mcp-get

## Build/Lint/Test Commands
- Build: `npm run build`
- Test all: `npm test`
- Test single file: `npm run test:file src/__tests__/file.test.ts`
- Test with watch: `npm run test:watch`
- Test coverage: `npm run test:coverage` 
- PR check: `npm run pr-check`
- Registry convert: `npm run registry:convert`
- Add package to registry: `npm run registry:add <package-file.json>`

## Code Style Guidelines
- **Module System**: ES Modules with `.js` extension in imports
- **Formatting**: 2-space indentation, semicolons, single quotes
- **Naming**: camelCase for functions/variables, PascalCase for interfaces/classes, kebab-case for files
- **Types**: Explicit typing for functions, parameters, and returns; interfaces in dedicated files
- **Error Handling**: Use try/catch blocks with appropriate console.error messages and error propagation
- **Testing**: Jest with mocks for external dependencies; test files in `__tests__` directories with `.test.ts` extension
- **Imports**: Group by external packages first, then internal modules
- **Async**: Use async/await pattern for asynchronous code
- **CLI Commands**: Follow command pattern with consistent structure in `commands/` directory
- **Configuration**: Use `ConfigManager` for managing persistent configurations

## Testing Guidelines
- Use proper TypeScript interfaces for mocks (with mockReturnValueOnce, mockResolvedValueOnce, etc.)
- When testing CLI commands, mock all dependencies including inquirer, chalk, and utils
- Use `as unknown as MockType` pattern for properly typing Jest mocks
- For interactive CLI testing, mock the inquirer.prompt response values

## Package Registry Structure
- Packages are stored as individual JSON files in the `packages/` directory
- Each file follows the naming convention: `packageName.json` (scoped packages use `scope--name.json`)
- Package files contain metadata and environment variables
- To add a new package:
  1. Create a JSON file with the package metadata
  2. Use `npm run registry:add <package-file.json>` to validate and add it to the registry
  3. Always run `npm run pr-check` before submitting a PR to validate package structure
- Environment variables should be included in the package file under the `environmentVariables` key
- The system will automatically find all packages by scanning the directory

## PR Guidelines for Package Additions
- Always run `npm run pr-check` before opening a PR to validate packages
- Package files must follow the standard format with all required fields
- For scoped packages (e.g., `@scope/name`), use double hyphens in filename (e.g., `scope--name.json`)
- Include an `environmentVariables` object even when empty
- Verify package name matches sourceUrl owner/format
- Ensure the license is correctly specified
- Maintain proper runtime specification (node/python)

### Converting from Old Format
- When a PR uses the old package-list.json format:
  1. Convert to individual package files in packages/ directory
  2. Follow proper naming convention (especially for scoped packages)
  3. Preserve all metadata from original PR exactly
  4. Ensure file format matches existing packages
  5. Reference the original PR and explain the reformatting in your new PR
  6. Close the original PR with a reference to your new PR
